    <h2>Descriptions</h2>
    <p>Bhel Puri is a very popular Mumbai street food snack made with puffed rice, puri, boiled potatoes, onions, various chutneys, herbs, ground spices and sev (fried gram flour vermicelli).</p>
    <h2>Step by step with ingredients</h2>
    <ol>
        <h3>Cook Potatoes</h3>
        <li>Rinse the potatoes very well in fresh water. Then boil 1 large potato or 2 medium sized potatoes in a 2-litre pressure cooker or in a pan with enough water.</li>
        <li>If using a pressure cooker, then pour water just about covering the potatoes. Sprinkle ¼ teaspoon salt and pressure cook for 4 to 5 whistles.</li>
        <li>Once the pressure settles down on its own in the cooker, then only open the lid. Drain the water and place the potatoes in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Let them cool or become warm. I was making some other snack as well, so I cooked more potatoes.</li>
        <h3>Make Green Chutney </h3>
        <li>Rinse and roughly chop ½ cup fresh coriander leaves (or ¼ cup mint leaves + ¼ cup coriander leaves). Place the coriander leaves in a small grinder jar.</li>
        <li>Also add ½ inch ginger (peeled and roughly chopped), 1 to 2 green chillies, ½ teaspoon chaat masala and ¼ teaspoon salt or as required.</li>
        <li>Add ½ teaspoon lemon juice for a tangy taste in the chutney.</li>
        <li>Add 2 to 3 tablespoons water or as required and grind or blend to a smooth chutney. Don’t make the green chutney thin. Remove the chutney in a bowl and keep aside.</li>
        <h3>Make Spicy Red Chutney</h3>
        <li>Peel 16 to 18 medium to large sized garlic cloves. Rinse them with water and place in the same grinder jar.</li>
        <li>Also sprinkle 2 teaspoons Kashmiri red chili powder and ¼ teaspoon salt or according to taste.

        </li>
        <li>Add 2 to 3 tablespoons water or as required and grind or blend to a smooth consistency. Remove red chutney in a bowl and keep aside.</li>
        <h3>Make Sweet Chutney</h3>
        <li>In a small pan take the following ingredients:

            3 tablespoons jaggery
            3 teaspoons amchur powder (dry mango powder)
            ¼ teaspoon Kashmiri red chilli powder
        </li>
        <li>Add 3 tablespoons water.</li>
        <li>Stir and mix very well.</li>
        <li>Keep this pan on the stovetop and heat on a low flame.</li>
        <li>Let the mixture gently heat on a low flame.</li>
        <li>When the mixture comes to a boil and thickens slightly, then switch off the heat. Keep aside. Check the taste and if required you can add more jaggery or mango powder if required.</li>
        <li>Peel and chop the potatoes into small cubes. Finely chop 1 small to medium-sized onion and 1 medium-sized tomato.

            You can also chop 1 green chilli if you want. Chop some coriander leaves too.</li>
        <li>Take 2 cups puffed rice (murmura, pori, mandakki) in a pan. On a low heat stirring often dry roast the puffed rice.</li>
        <li>This is not an essential step and you need to roast the puffed rice if they are not crisp. If they are crisp and crunchy, then you do not need to roast them.</li>
        <li>Roast the puffed rice stirring often for 2 to 3 minutes till they become crisp. You don’t need to brown them. Let the puffed rice cool at room temperature.</li>
        <h3>Make Bhel Puri</h3>
        <li>Assemble everything before you begin. Keep the chutneys in a bowl. These chutneys stay well for about a week in the fridge. So you can keep the leftovers in the fridge.</li>
        <li>In a bowl now take the chopped boiled potatoes, onions and tomatoes. You can also include some boiled moong beans or steamed moong bean sprouts at this step.
        </li>
        <li>Add sweet chutney, green chutney and red chutney. You can add the quantity of chutneys as per the taste you want in a bhel puri.

            For a spicy bhel puri recipe, include more of the red chutney and green chutney. For a sweet taste add more of the sweet chutney.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle ½ to 1 teaspoon chaat masala and ½ teaspoon roasted cumin powder. Also, sprinkle some black salt as per taste.

            If you do not have black salt, then use pink salt, edible rock salt or regular white salt.</li>
        <li>Drizzle ½ to 1 teaspoon lemon juice or according to taste.</li>
        <li>Stir and mix very well.</li>
        <li>Now add 1 tablespoon masala chana (optional) and 2 tablespoons roasted peanuts (optional). At this step, you can also top up with some crushed puri or papdi.</li>
        <li>Add puffed rice.</li>
        <li>Add ¼ cup sev (fried gram flour vermicelli).</li>
        <li>With a spoon, just swirl the whole mixture together well and be quick.</li>
        <li>Serve bhel puri immediately in individual bowls or plates. Top up with some sev, puri or papdi and more coriander leaves if you want.

            If you don’t serve bhelpuri immediately then the puffed rice will become soggy and you won’t enjoy it. So be quick in serving. Assemble this dish only when you want to serve or eat it.</li>
