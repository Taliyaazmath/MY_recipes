    <ol>
        <h3>Green chutney</h3>
        <li>Rinse 2 cups of coriander leaves well in water. Drain the water and roughly chop them. Take all the ingredients listed below in a blender.

        
        <li>chopped coriander leaves</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chopped chillies - add more for a spicy taste</li>
        <li>1 inch ginger</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon cumin powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon chaat masala</li>
        <li>¼ to ½ teaspoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon black salt or regular salt</li>
        </li>
        <li>Add 1 or 2 teaspoons water and grind to a smooth chutney. Add a few teaspoons more of the water if required. But don’t make the chutney too thin or runny.</li>
        <li>Remove the chutney in a bowl and set aside. Cover and refrigerate if making sev puri after some hours or next day.</li>
        <h3>Red chilli chutney</h3>
        <li>Break and deseed 15 to 16 dry Kashmiri red chilies. Soak the red chilies in hot water for about 20 to 30 minutes. The water just needs to cover them. Peel and roughly chop 8 to 9 medium garlic cloves.

        </li>
        <li>Drain all the water from the red chilies after 20 to 30 minutes. Add the red chillies, garlic and salt according to taste in a blender or grinder.</li>
        <p>Adding very little water grind or blend both the red chilies and garlic until smooth. The consistency of the chutney should be more towards thicker side or of medium consistency.</p>
        <li>Pour the red chilli garlic chutney in a small jar or bowl. Cover and refrigerate.</li>
        <h3>Make Tamarind Chutney</h3>
        <li>Rinse ½ cup tamarind (remove seeds if any) in a strainer. In a pan, take the tamarind, ½ cup dates (seedless or pitted) and 2 cups water.</li>
        <p>Cook the tamarind and dates for about 8 to 9 minutes on a low heat or until they soften.</p>
        <li>When the tamarind and dates have softened, add ½ cup of powdered or chopped jaggery and continue to cook. Let the jaggery dissolve completely and the mixture thicken a bit.

        </li>
        <li>Add all the spice powders – ¼ to ½ teaspoon red chili powder or cayenne, ½ teaspoon coriander powder, ½ teaspoon dry ginger powder (ground ginger) and ½ teaspoon roasted cumin powder.</li>
        <li>Mix well and simmer for a further 1 to 2 minutes more. Season with salt according to taste. Let the chutney mixture cool at room temperature.</li>
        <li>In a chutney grinder or small blender, grind this whole mixture until smooth. Add some water if needed while blending or grinding. Strain the chutney through a strainer if desired.</li>
        <li>Store the tamarind date chutney in an airtight bowl or container in the refrigerator and use it when you make chaat at home.

        </li>
        <li>his recipe will give you a bowl of thick tamarind chutney, which you can easily refrigerate for a month or freeze for 2 to 3 months.

        </li>
        <h3>Assembling Sev Puri</h3>
        <li>First keep all the elements (chutneys, potatoes, onions, tomatoes, ground spices, salt, sev etc) that you need in your workplace before you begin to assemble sev puri.</li>
        <li>Prep 2 to 3 medium to large potatoes by boiling them until tender and softened. Cook potatoes in a pressure cooker, pan or Instant Pot. When warm or cool, peel and chop them in small cubes.</li>
        <li>Finely chop the onions, tomatoes and coriander leaves. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Top up with chopped boiled potatoes cubes.</li>
        <li> Then add finely chopped onions. Top with some chopped finely tomatoes. Sprinkle some chaat masala, if you want at this point.</li>
        <li>Top with just a touch of spicy red chilli garlic chutney – about ¼ to ½ teaspoon. Add in fewer amounts as this chutney is very spicy.</li>
        <li>Using this chutney is optional and you can substitute it with red chili powder. Though you won’t get the same taste with red chili powder. But something is better than nothing.</li>
        <li>Top up with the 1 to 2 teaspoons of green chutney or as much as you want.</li>
        <li>Now top with 1 to 2 teaspoons of sweet chutney or more if you like. Vary the amount of green chutney or sweet chutney according to your taste.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle 2 to 3 pinches of chaat masala, roasted cumin powder and black salt or rock salt or regular salt.</li>
        <li> Sprinkle sev evenly all over on the sev puri. Ensure to use the finer variety of sev as the thicker ones simply do not give the best authentic taste.</li>
        <li>Lastly garnish with some chopped coriander leaves (cilantro).</li>
        <li>Sprinkle a few drops of lemon juice to add some brightness and tang to the dish.</li>
        <li>add sev</li>
    </ol>
