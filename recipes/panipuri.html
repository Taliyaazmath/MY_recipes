        <li>Rinse coriander and mint leaves in water and take all the ingredients of pani.</li>

        <li>Grind until smooth paste (if required, add 1/4 cup water while grinding).</li>
        <li>Transfer them to a large bowl and add sugar, chaat masala powder, black salt and 4 cups water. Stir with a large spoon and mix it properly. Taste for the salt and add as required. Pani is ready; place it in a refrigerator for at least 1-hour before serving or use it at room temperature. If you like soft boondi, mix it now. If you like crispy taste of boondi then mix it at the time of serving.
